## Security Features

### Threat Detection Patterns

The system detects the following threat patterns:
- Script injection (`<script>`, `javascript:`, `vbscript:`)
- Code execution (`eval()`, `exec()`, `system()`)
- Server-side scripts (`<?php`, `<%`, shell scripts)
- SQL injection attempts (`UNION SELECT`, `DROP TABLE`)
- Command execution (`cmd.exe`, `powershell`)
- Executable signatures (MZ, ELF headers)

### File Validation Layers

1. **Basic Validation**: File size, type, extension
2. **Content Validation**: MIME type verification, file signatures
3. **Security Validation**: Malware pattern detection, entropy analysis
4. **Category-Specific**: Image verification (PIL), audio validation, document checks
5. **Integrity Checking**: SHA-256 hash generation and verification

### Access Control

- **User Isolation**: Files stored in user-specific directories
- **Secure Paths**: Sanitized filenames with timestamp and hash
- **Permission Control**: Restrictive file permissions (600)
- **Quarantine System**: Isolated storage for threatening files

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring

- Continuous monitoring of file upload security events
- Automatic threat detection and response
- User activity pattern analysis
- System health monitoring

### Alert System

- **Critical Alerts**: Immediate email notifications for security threats

## Configuration

### Settings Required

```python
# File upload settings
FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB

# Email settings for alerts
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'security@zamio.com'
EMAIL_HOST = 'your-smtp-server'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-password'

# Media settings
MEDIA_ROOT = '/path/to/media'
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
```

### Celery Configuration

The implementation requires Celery with Redis broker for:
- Asynchronous file scanning
- Security monitoring tasks
- Alert notifications
- Cleanup operations

## Usage Examples

### Validating File Uploads

```python
from core.services.unified_file_security import UnifiedFileSecurityService

# Validate an image upload
try:
    result = UnifiedFileSecurityService.validate_file(
        uploaded_file, 
        'image', 
        request.user
    )
    # File is safe to process
except ValidationError as e:
    # Handle validation errors
    return Response({'errors': e.messages}, status=400)
```

### Processing Secure Uploads

```python
# Process with comprehensive security
result = UnifiedFileSecurityService.process_secure_upload(
    file=uploaded_file,
    category='audio',
    user=request.user,
    entity_type='Track',
    entity_id=track.id
)
```

### Monitoring Security Events

```python
from core.services.file_security_monitor import FileSecurityMonitor

# Check current security alerts
alerts = FileSecurityMonitor.check_security_alerts()

# Generate security report
report = FileSecurityMonitor.generate_security_report(hours=24)
```

## Testing

### Running Security Tests

```bash
# Test all security components
python manage.py test_file_security --test-type=all --verbose

# Test specific components
python manage.py test_file_security --test-type=validation
python manage.py test_file_security --test-type=scanning
python manage.py test_file_security --test-type=monitoring
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Upload Valid Files**: Test with legitimate image, audio, document files
2. **Upload Invalid Files**: Test with executables, scripts, oversized files
3. **Upload Malicious Files**: Test with files containing threat patterns
4. **Monitor Alerts**: Verify alert system responds to threats
5. **Check Quarantine**: Verify threatening files are quarantined

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- Monitor quarantine directory size
- Review security reports and alerts
- Update threat detection patterns
- Validate audit log retention
- Test backup and recovery procedures

### Performance Considerations

- File scanning adds processing overhead
- Large files may require longer processing times
- Quarantine directory requires periodic cleanup
- Audit logs require retention management

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep threat detection patterns updated
2. **Monitor Alerts**: Respond promptly to security alerts
3. **Review Logs**: Regular audit log analysis
4. **Test Security**: Periodic security testing
5. **User Education**: Train users on secure file practices

- Industry security standards
- Audit requirements
- Incident response procedures

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
