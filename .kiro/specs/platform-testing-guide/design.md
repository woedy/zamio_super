# Platform Testing Guide Design

## Overview

The Platform Testing Guide will be a comprehensive markdown document that provides structured testing procedures for all ZamIO platform features. The guide will be organized by application and user role, with clear step-by-step instructions, expected outcomes, and validation criteria for each test scenario.

## Architecture

### Document Structure
```
Platform_Testing_Guide.md
├── Introduction & Setup
├── Backend API Testing
├── Artist Portal Testing  
├── Admin Dashboard Testing
├── Publisher Portal Testing
├── Station Portal Testing
├── Mobile App Testing
├── End-to-End Workflows
├── Integration Testing
└── Troubleshooting & Common Issues
```

### Testing Categories

1. **Unit-Level Testing**: Individual feature validation within each application
2. **Integration Testing**: Cross-application workflow validation
3. **User Role Testing**: Role-specific functionality validation
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete business process validation

## Components and Interfaces

### Testing Sections

#### 1. Backend API Testing
- Authentication endpoints (login, registration, JWT refresh)
- Artist management APIs (profile, music upload, KYC)
- Music monitoring APIs (fingerprinting, detection results)
- Royalty calculation APIs (airplay data, payment processing)
- Publisher management APIs (agreements, splits, catalogs)
- Station management APIs (log submission, compliance)
- Admin APIs (user management, system monitoring)

#### 2. Frontend Application Testing
Each portal will have dedicated testing sections:
- **Artist Portal**: Music upload, profile management, royalty tracking
- **Admin Dashboard**: User management, KYC approval, system monitoring
- **Publisher Portal**: Catalog management, agreement handling, split configuration
- **Station Portal**: Log submission, compliance monitoring, reporting

#### 3. Mobile App Testing
- Audio capture functionality
- Background recording capabilities
- Upload and sync processes
- User authentication and profile management

#### 4. Cross-Application Workflows
- Complete artist onboarding (registration → KYC → music upload)
- End-to-end royalty distribution (airplay → calculation → payment)
- Station compliance monitoring (log submission → validation → reporting)
- Publisher agreement management (creation → artist assignment → royalty splits)

## Data Models

### Test Case Structure
```markdown
### Test Case: [Feature Name]
**Objective**: [What this test validates]
**Prerequisites**: [Required setup/data]
**Steps**:
1. [Detailed step with expected outcome]
2. [Next step with validation criteria]
**Expected Results**: [What should happen]
**Validation**: [How to confirm success]
**Notes**: [Additional considerations]
```

### Test Data Requirements
- Sample user accounts for each role (artist, publisher, station, admin)
- Sample music files for upload testing
- Sample audio files for fingerprinting
- Sample station logs for compliance testing
- Test payment/wallet configurations

## Error Handling

### Test Failure Documentation
- Clear identification of failure points
- Expected vs actual behavior documentation
- Screenshots or logs for UI issues
- API response documentation for backend issues

### Common Issue Resolution
- Environment setup problems
- Authentication failures
- File upload issues
- Payment processing errors
- Mobile app connectivity problems

## Testing Strategy

### Test Environment Setup
1. **Local Development Environment**
   - Docker Compose setup validation
   - Database seeding with test data
   - Service connectivity verification

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Production-like configuration testing
   - External service integration validation
   - Performance and load considerations

### Test Execution Approach
1. **Sequential Testing**: Follow logical user journey progression
2. **Parallel Testing**: Independent feature validation across applications
3. **Regression Testing**: Validation after code changes
4. **Smoke Testing**: Basic functionality verification

### Test Coverage Areas
- **Functional Testing**: Feature behavior validation
- **UI/UX Testing**: Interface and user experience validation
- **API Testing**: Backend service validation
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-service communication validation
- **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization validation
- **Performance Testing**: Response time and load validation

### Documentation Standards
- Clear, numbered steps for reproducibility
- Screenshots for UI-heavy processes
- Code snippets for API testing
- Expected vs actual result documentation
- Cross-references between related test scenarios
