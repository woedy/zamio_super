# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the enhancement of the user email verification system across all ZamIO applications to support both verification codes and verification links, providing users with flexible options for email verification. Currently, the system only supports link-based verification, which can be problematic for users who prefer or need code-based verification due to email client limitations, security preferences, or accessibility needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dual Verification Method Support

**User Story:** As a user registering on any ZamIO platform, I want to choose between email verification via a clickable link or a verification code, so that I can use the method that works best for my email client and security preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL offer both verification link and verification code options
2. WHEN a user selects verification code method THEN the system SHALL send a 6-digit numeric code via email
3. WHEN a user selects verification link method THEN the system SHALL send a clickable verification link via email
4. WHEN a user requests to resend verification THEN the system SHALL maintain their previously selected method preference
5. WHEN a user wants to switch verification methods THEN the system SHALL allow changing between code and link methods

### Requirement 2: Verification Code Generation and Management

**User Story:** As a user who prefers verification codes, I want to receive a secure, time-limited verification code, so that I can verify my email address by entering the code in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verification code is generated THEN the system SHALL create a 6-digit numeric code
2. WHEN a verification code is created THEN the system SHALL set expiration time to 15 minutes
3. WHEN a verification code is used successfully THEN the system SHALL invalidate the code immediately
4. WHEN a verification code expires THEN the system SHALL prevent its use and require a new code
5. WHEN multiple verification codes are requested THEN the system SHALL invalidate previous codes and use only the latest

### Requirement 3: Verification Code Input Interface

**User Story:** As a user who received a verification code, I want an intuitive interface to enter my 6-digit code, so that I can complete email verification easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the verification code input is displayed THEN the system SHALL show 6 separate input fields for each digit
2. WHEN a user types in a code field THEN the system SHALL automatically advance to the next field
3. WHEN a user backspaces in a code field THEN the system SHALL move to the previous field if current is empty
4. WHEN all 6 digits are entered THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt verification
5. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL clear the input fields and show an error message

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Email Templates

**User Story:** As a user receiving verification emails, I want clear, professional emails that explain both verification methods, so that I understand my options and can complete verification successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verification email is sent THEN the system SHALL include both the verification code and verification link
2. WHEN the email template is rendered THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between the two verification methods
3. WHEN the email is displayed THEN the system SHALL include expiration times for both methods
4. WHEN the email contains a verification code THEN the system SHALL format it prominently and clearly
5. WHEN the email contains instructions THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance for both methods

### Requirement 5: Backend API Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the verification system, I want comprehensive API endpoints that support both verification methods, so that I can implement flexible verification flows in frontend applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification is initiated THEN the API SHALL support method selection (code or link)
2. WHEN code verification is requested THEN the API SHALL accept and validate 6-digit codes
3. WHEN link verification is requested THEN the API SHALL accept and validate verification tokens
4. WHEN verification method is changed THEN the API SHALL invalidate previous verification data
5. WHEN verification status is checked THEN the API SHALL return current method and expiration information

### Requirement 6: Security and Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security measures for email verification, so that the system prevents abuse while maintaining usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification attempts are made THEN the system SHALL limit to 5 attempts per 15-minute period
2. WHEN rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL temporarily block further attempts for 30 minutes
3. WHEN verification codes are generated THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
4. WHEN verification data is stored THEN the system SHALL hash sensitive verification information
5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring

### Requirement 7: Cross-Platform Consistency

**User Story:** As a user accessing different ZamIO applications, I want consistent email verification experience across all platforms, so that I have a unified experience regardless of which application I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification is initiated from zamio_frontend THEN the system SHALL provide the same verification options as other platforms
2. WHEN verification is initiated from zamio_admin THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI patterns and flows
3. WHEN verification is initiated from zamio_stations THEN the system SHALL use the same backend verification logic
4. WHEN verification is initiated from zamio_publisher THEN the system SHALL provide identical verification capabilities
5. WHEN verification is initiated from zamio_app THEN the system SHALL support both methods through mobile-optimized interfaces

### Requirement 8: Accessibility and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the verification interface to be fully accessible and user-friendly, so that I can complete email verification regardless of my abilities or assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification code inputs are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
2. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard accessibility for code entry
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL announce verification progress and errors clearly
4. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
5. WHEN verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide clear confirmation and next steps

### Requirement 9: Audit and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of verification activities, so that I can monitor system usage, detect issues, and maintain security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
