# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for preparing the ZamIO platform for production deployment using Coolify, while maintaining Docker Compose for local development. The goal is to create production-ready configurations, optimize build processes, and ensure secure, scalable deployment without disrupting the existing local development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Production Build Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want production-optimized Docker configurations, so that the application runs efficiently and securely in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage Docker builds for all React applications
2. WHEN building React applications THEN the system SHALL create optimized production bundles using `npm run build`
3. WHEN deploying backend services THEN the system SHALL use production-ready ASGI server configuration
4. IF building for production THEN the system SHALL exclude development dependencies and tools
5. WHEN creating production images THEN the system SHALL implement proper layer caching for faster builds

### Requirement 2: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want environment-specific configurations, so that I can deploy to different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to any environment THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all configuration
2. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL NOT require hardcoded URL changes in source code
3. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with required variables
4. WHEN configuring CORS THEN the system SHALL accept dynamic origins based on environment variables
5. WHEN setting up SSL THEN the system SHALL support HTTPS configuration through environment variables

### Requirement 3: Service Communication and Networking

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want proper service discovery and communication, so that services can communicate reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services communicate THEN the system SHALL use environment-based service URLs
2. WHEN deploying on Coolify THEN the system SHALL support internal service networking
3. IF a service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms
4. WHEN configuring API endpoints THEN the system SHALL support both internal and external URLs
5. WHEN setting up load balancing THEN the system SHALL work with Coolify's proxy configuration

### Requirement 4: Database and Redis Configuration

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want production-ready database configurations, so that data is secure and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to databases THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling for production
2. WHEN configuring Redis THEN the system SHALL support external Redis instances
3. IF database connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection retry logic
4. WHEN running migrations THEN the system SHALL support automated migration execution
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL support volume persistence configuration

### Requirement 5: Security and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want production security measures, so that the application is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL disable debug mode and development tools
2. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL implement proper caching headers
3. IF handling user uploads THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
5. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive information from logs

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Health Checks

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive health monitoring, so that I can ensure system availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints
2. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL expose metrics for key operations
3. IF services become unhealthy THEN the system SHALL provide detailed status information
4. WHEN scaling services THEN the system SHALL support readiness and liveness probes
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide structured logging with correlation IDs

### Requirement 7: Deployment Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment processes, so that I can deploy changes reliably and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying applications THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments
2. WHEN building images THEN the system SHALL tag images with version information
3. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities
4. WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL validate environment variables
5. WHEN deploying multiple services THEN the system SHALL handle service dependencies properly

### Requirement 8: Local Development Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing local development workflow, so that development productivity is not impacted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL continue using Docker Compose
2. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL maintain separate configuration files
3. IF local setup changes THEN the system SHALL update documentation accordingly
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
5. WHEN debugging locally THEN the system SHALL maintain hot-reload and development tools
