# Stakeholder Sign-off Package

## Purpose
This package equips Zamio champions, PRO partners, and internal stakeholders with a concise briefing, demo agenda, and follow-up roadmap that demonstrates production readiness for Ghanaian and international royalty administration. It complements the discovery, security, deployment, and testing assets already delivered.

## Audience Alignment
| Stakeholder | Primary Goals | Key Messages |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Executive Sponsors | Confirm market readiness, compliance posture, and monetization plan. | Zamio orchestrates end-to-end royalty intake, matching, distribution, and reporting aligned with PRO-grade obligations. |
| PRO Partners (ASCAP, BMI, BMAT, etc.) | Validate interoperability, data fidelity, and governance controls. | Zamioâ€™s ingestion pipelines, audit trails, and settlement tooling follow international schemas and expose integration hooks. |
| Operations & Admin Teams | Ensure day-to-day processes are efficient, auditable, and trainable. | Dashboards, approval flows, and analytics scripts are structured for rapid onboarding and continuous improvement. |
| Engineering & QA | Confirm technical resilience, security posture, and deployment smoothness. | Hardened middleware, environment templates, and `.SuperTest` charters underpin ongoing reliability. |

## Demo Script & Narrative Flow
Each section maps to a corresponding `.SuperTest` manual validation file to reinforce acceptance evidence.

1. **Platform Overview & Access Control**  
   - Walk through SSO/MFA entry (if configured) and highlight role-based dashboards.  
   - Confirm global navigation reflects unified theming and responsive layouts.  
   - Reference security hardening updates (headers, CSP, HSTS gating) to frame trust posture.  
   - Evidence: `005_governance_audit.md` (audit trail checkpoints).

2. **Artist Onboarding & Catalog Submission**  
   - Showcase self-service artist registration, catalog upload, metadata validation, and payout preference capture.  
   - Demonstrate light/dark mode parity on high-traffic forms.  
   - Evidence: `.SuperTest/001_artist_onboarding.md`.

3. **Publisher & Station Integrations**  
   - Upload a publisher catalog, auto-map IP ownership splits, and stage tracks for airplay monitoring.  
   - Transition to station ingestion to reconcile play logs against the catalog.  
   - Evidence: `.SuperTest/002_publisher_ingestion.md` and `.SuperTest/003_station_reporting.md`.

4. **Royalty Calculation & Distribution**  
   - Use the admin dashboard to run settlement cycles, approve payouts, and surface exception handling (unmatched works, disputed splits).  
   - Demonstrate payout exports and partner remittance summaries.  
   - Evidence: `.SuperTest/004_royalty_distribution.md`.

5. **Compliance & Governance**  
   - Present audit logs, immutable change tracking, and configurable retention windows.  
   - Highlight alerting hooks (webhooks/email) for regulatory thresholds.  
   - Evidence: `.SuperTest/005_governance_audit.md` and `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`.

6. **Operational Runbooks & Deployment Confidence**  
   - Review the Coolify deployment playbook and environment variable catalog (`deploy/coolify/README.md`, `zamio_backend/env.coolify.example`).  
   - Point to automated tests (`tests/test_security_headers.py`) and manual QA inventory for regression assurance.  
   - Discuss monitoring/logging plans (to be finalized with hosting provider).

## Release Notes (Stakeholder Edition)
- **Experience Parity**: Unified theming baseline established; landing page redesigned for investor/artist storytelling; dark mode audits documented for remediation.
- **Security Enhancements**: Middleware enforces modern headers (CSP, Permissions Policy, COOP/COEP); SSL/HSTS toggles default to secure configurations when enabled.
- **Operational Readiness**: Coolify-specific Dockerfiles, entrypoints, and nginx configs allow role-targeted deployments for backend and React frontends.  
- **Quality Assurance**: `.SuperTest` suite enumerates manual regression scripts; Django regression tests safeguard critical headers.
- **Documentation Footprint**: `CONTEXT_ALIGNMENT.md`, `UI_THEMING_BASELINE.md`, and `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` provide cross-team references.

## Acceptance Matrix
| Requirement | Evidence | Status |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Artist onboarding + catalog ingestion validated | `.SuperTest/001_artist_onboarding.md` & `.SuperTest/002_publisher_ingestion.md` | Ready |
| Station reporting & reconciliation | `.SuperTest/003_station_reporting.md` | Ready |
| Royalty settlement & payouts | `.SuperTest/004_royalty_distribution.md` | Ready |
| Governance, compliance, and audit readiness | `.SuperTest/005_governance_audit.md`, `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` | Ready |
| Deployment instructions for Coolify | `deploy/coolify/README.md`, `zamio_backend/Dockerfile.coolify` | Ready |
| Theming roadmap & landing page redesign | `UI_THEMING_BASELINE.md`, `zamio_frontend/src/pages/Landing/LandingPage.tsx` | Ready |

## Improvement Backlog Suggestions
1. **Data Partnerships**: Formalize APIs for Ghanaian broadcasters and ISRC/ISWC authorities to automate catalog validation.
2. **Analytics & Forecasting**: Layer machine-learning insights on top of station reports to predict royalty flows and flag anomalies sooner.
3. **Self-Service Portals**: Extend admin tooling for publishers/labels to self-manage splits, disputes, and compliance attestations.
4. **Observability Enhancements**: Integrate structured logging, metrics, and alerting (e.g., OpenTelemetry + Grafana) into the deployment guide.
5. **Mobile Deep Dives**: Expand Flutter test coverage and UX parity audits to fully align with the refreshed web design system.

## Next Steps for Sign-off
- Circulate this package alongside demo recordings or live sessions for executive and partner review.  
- Capture feedback in a shared tracker, tagging items as immediate fixes vs. roadmap opportunities.  
- Maintain the `.SuperTest` suite as new features emerge to preserve stakeholder confidence in regression coverage.
